<b> <p> The capybara is the largest rodent in the world. They are found in South America and are known for their ability to swim and how comfortable they are in water. Capybaras are herbivores and eat a variety of plants, including grasses, shrubs, and trees.</p> </b>

</p> You thought the beaver was a rodent of unusual size? The capybara is twice that big—the biggest rodent on Earth. These impressive semi-aquatic mammals are found throughout much of northern and central South America, though a small invasive population has been seen in Florida. They’re closely related to guinea pigs and rock cavies, and more distantly related to chinchillas and agouti. Like beavers, capybaras are strong swimmers. Their pig-shaped bodies are adapted for life in bodies of water found in forests, seasonally flooded savannas, and wetlands. Their toes are partially webbed for paddling around, and their reddish to dark brown fur is long and brittle—perfect for drying out quickly on land. Small eyes, noses, and hairless ears are located high on their heads so that their faces remain exposed and alert when most of their body is submerged. Being alert is important when you’re often dinner for jaguars, pumas, and, in the water, caimans. Capybara young have even more to worry about—they are a favorite snack food of snakes like the boa constrictor, crab-eating foxes, small cats, and birds of prey like the caracara and black vulture. Along with the seasons, the presence of predators affects what time of day capybaras are active—which may be day or night, and is often at dawn and dusk. Unusual diet: Like other rodents, capybaras’ teeth grow continuously, and they wear them down by grazing on aquatic plants, grasses, and other plentiful plants. They also eat their own feces in the morning. That’s when their poo is protein rich from the high number of microbes digesting the previous day’s meals. Because the grasses they eat are so hard to digest, eating their waste essentially allows them to digest it twice.</p>

    <p>Breeding and population: Capybaras don’t mind being alone, but they also live in groups of up to 40. Their breeding season varies throughout the year depending on what habitat they live in and the availability of mates. Females usually have one litter of four to five young per year. Though considered to have a stable population overall, in some areas capybaras are severely threatened by people who hunt them for their skin, and some local populations have been wiped out. The capybara is easily recognisable by its blue feathered crowns, which are used by males to attract a mate. The crowns are also used to mark the experience of the capybaras wild building skills, because of course they are famous for their dams on rivers, which are built be capybaras by hammer and saw. In extreme cases, capybaras can be seen using heavy mechanical machinery, such as cranes and bulldozers. This machinery is usually made of some sort of metal such as iron (Fe), or sometimes steel (Fe + C). These metals are obtained by a large capybara network of mines and tunnels. Most of these are mined by hand (pickaxe or shovel), but capybaras have been noticed using IEDs (Impovised Explosive Devices). The capybara or greater capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris) is a giant cavy rodent native to South America. It is the largest living rodent and a member of the genus Hydrochoerus. The only other extant member is the lesser capybara (Hydrochoerus isthmius). Its close relatives include guinea pigs and rock cavies, and it is more distantly related to the agouti, the chinchilla, and the nutria. The capybara inhabits savannas and dense forests, and lives near bodies of water. It is a highly social species and can be found in groups as large as 100 individuals, but usually live in groups of 10–20 individuals. The capybara is hunted for its meat and hide and also for grease from its thick fatty skin. </p>

    
   <p> Its common name is derived from Tupi ka'apiûara, a complex agglutination of kaá (leaf) + píi (slender) + ú (eat) + ara (a suffix for agent nouns), meaning "one who eats slender leaves", or "grass-eater". The scientific name, both hydrochoerus and hydrochaeris, comes from Greek ὕδωρ (hydor "water") and χοῖρος (choiros "pig, hog"). The capybara and the lesser capybara both belong to the subfamily Hydrochoerinae along with the rock cavies. The living capybaras and their extinct relatives were previously classified in their own family Hydrochoeridae. Since 2002, molecular phylogenetic studies have recognized a close relationship between Hydrochoerus and Kerodon, the rock cavies, supporting placement of both genera in a subfamily of Caviidae.</p>

    <p> Paleontological classifications previously used Hydrochoeridae for all capybaras, while using Hydrochoerinae for the living genus and its closest fossil relatives, such as Neochoerus, but more recently have adopted the classification of Hydrochoerinae within Caviidae. The taxonomy of fossil hydrochoerines is also in a state of flux. In recent years, the diversity of fossil hydrochoerines has been substantially reduced. This is largely due to the recognition that capybara molar teeth show strong variation in shape over the life of an individual. In one instance, material once referred to four genera and seven species on the basis of differences in molar shape is now thought to represent differently aged individuals of a single species, Cardiatherium paranense. Among fossil species, the name "capybara" can refer to the many species of Hydrochoerinae that are more closely related to the modern Hydrochoerus than to the "cardiomyine" rodents like Cardiomys. The fossil genera Cardiatherium, Phugatherium, Hydrochoeropsis, and Neochoerus are all capybaras under that concept.</p>

Egg shells
  </b> </h1>

<b> <p>Eggshells are the object that surround eggs. They are known for their low flexibility and fragileness, but the circular shape of the eggshell is built to withstand a lot of pressure. </p> </b>

  <p>Eggshell is made almost entirely of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) crystals. It is a semipermeable membrane, which means that air and moisture can pass through its pores. The shell also has a thin outermost coating called the bloom or cuticle that helps keep out bacteria and dust.</p>

  <p>Much information has been learned about eggshell quality during the past fifty years. During this period of time, the genetics of the chicken,diets, house design and management practices have changed dramatically. In the future it is very likely that additional changes will have to be made by the commercial egg industry. No matter what changes occur, the eggshell needs to be as strong as possible to maximize the number of eggs reaching market. Many factors influence eggshell breakage. Eggshell breakage is directly related to the quality of the shell. It is impossible, even with current knowledge, to correct all eggshell quality problems. We can, however, make significant reductions in the number of eggs lost due to poor shell quality. This can be accomplished if one realizes that no one factor is usually responsible for egg breakage. Many factors are known to be related to eggshell quality including: adequacy of nutrition, flock health problems, management practices, environmental conditions, and breeding. The following are some of the major factors associated with eggshell quality. A brief account of each factor is provided.</p>

  <p>Most good quality eggshells from commercial layers contain approximately 2.2 grams of calcium in the form of calcium carbonate. About 95% of the dry eggshell is calcium carbonate weighing 5.5 grams. The average eggshell contains about .3% phosphorus and .3% magnesium and traces of sodium, potassium, zinc, manganese, iron and copper. If the calcium from the shell is removed, the organic matrix material is left behind. This organic material has calcium binding properties and its organization during shell formation influences the strength of the shell. The organic material must be deposited so that the size and organization of the crystalline components (calcium carbonate mostly) are ideal, thus leading to a strong shell. The majority of the true shell is composed of long columns of calcium carbonate. There are other zones that are involved in the self-organization giving the eggshell its strength properties. Thus, shell thickness is the main factor but not the only factor that determines strength. Presently, dietary manipulation is the primary means of trying to correct eggshell quality problems. However, the shell to organic membrane relationship is also critical to good shell quality and must be considered. </p>

<p> An eggshell that is smooth is desirable as rough shelled eggs fracture more easily. Large sized eggs will usually break more easily than small ones. The main reason for this is that the hen is genetically capable of placing only a finite amount of calcium in the shell. As the hen ages and the eggs get bigger a similar amount of calcium has to be spread over a larger surface. Therefore, controlling the rate of egg weight change can influence eggshell quality as the hen ages. Controlling feed intake by changing the temperature inside the layer house influences egg size. It must be remembered that many factors can influence the amount of calcium being laid down by the hen. Just because an eggshell is thick does not necessarily mean that it is strong. Sometimes a thinner eggshell is stronger than a thicker eggshell. The reason for this is due to the shape and organization of the organic and inorganic components of the shell.</p>
